# Homework 3

Explain each subject below, and provide at least one example.

* Main and Print  

main function is where we excute our code and its mandotry for the the excution of any code.
print is function that simlpy display whatever written inside it. it is used while developming a program and does not effect delivered program, some programmes like to debugg using print

* Syntax

syntax of progrmaing language indicate how certain functions and code are written. we may write the same pragram in two different programing language whith the same abroach, but only the script is different because two languages have different syntax

* Data Types 
data types are used to represent data, for example we can store a text as a string which is a data type.

example of data types:
integers, float, double, boolean, string

the concept of data data type is important to avoid making mistakes, a function might be applicable only for strings, without specifying the data types of inputs will face a fault


* Variable  & Const 

we can store data in a variable or caonstant, the difference betwean the two is a variable can be change by the code while excuting, the constant will never change unless we change the code ourself

* String interpolation 

String interpolation is a way in which we insert our variable, const or expression in a string as such 

"my name is $name"
the $name will be replaced by the value of name


* Operators 

there are different types of operators which are necessery to develop a program, some of these operators are

arithmatic operator + , - , ++ , -- , * , /
comparison operator >=, <= , !==, ===, = , >, <
logical operator ||, &&


* Null Safety

null safty is used to prevent errors, because sometime not all variable will have a value and your program will try to access this variable and use it which cause an error.
