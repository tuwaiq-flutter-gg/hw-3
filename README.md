# Homework 3

Explain each subject below, and provide at least one example.

* Main and Print


 Every C program must have a main function, which must be given the name main. The main function is where the program is executed from. By directing calls to other program functions, it often controls how the program is executed. 

* Syntax


Syntax refers to a concept in writing code that deals with a very particular set of words and a very precise order to those words when we give the computer instructions. This order and this strict structure is what makes us able  to communicate efficiently with a computer.

* Data Types


A data type is a way to classify data and instructsÂ the compiler or interpreter of how the programmer plans to use the data.
Most programming languages support various types of data which inludes

Data Type                   Represents	                     Examples


integer	                    whole numbers	             -5, 0, 123
floating point (real)	    fractional numbers	             -87.5, 0.0, 3.14159
string	                    A sequence of characters	     "Hello world!"
Boolean	                    logical true or false	     true, false
nothing	                    no data	                     null

* Variable  & Const

The value stored in a variable could change during the running of the program whereas values stored in constants cannot be changed during the runningb of the program 

* String interpolation
 In computer programming, string interpolation is the process of replacing placeholders with values in a string literal. 

an example in python;

name = 'World'
program = 'Python'
print(f'Hello {name}! This is {program}')
 
* Operators

in  computer programming, an operator is a character that represents a specific mathematical or logical action or process

most used types of operators are 

arithmatic operator   + , - , ++ , -- , * , /
comparison operator   >=, <= , !==, ===, = , >, <
logical operator      || , && , ! 

* Null Safety

Null safety stops errors that are resulted from unintentional access of variables set to null
