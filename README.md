# Homework 3

Explain each subject below, and provide at least one example.

### Main and Print
  1. main: its mean the function that will run when you complile your App and it has the calls to others function
  2. print: its mean the function that show the output throught the console
  

  ##### example:
      void main(){          // when we run the program it will excute this function
      print("Hello World"); // it will print to the console the message (Hello World)
      }

### Syntax
  is the way to write a specific programing language each progrmaing language has its own way to write it you can write hello world in diffrent programing language   but the code will be diffret even though the output is the same

  ##### example:
     1. dart syntax
        void main(){
          print("Hello World");
          }
          
      2. Java syntax
          public static void main(String[] args) {
          System.out.println("Hello World");
          }
  the output will be the same

### Data Types
  data type its refers to the type of the value
  which can be a list of things such as strings and numbers ...
   ##### for example:
          1. int: whole number
          2. Bollean: logical value (true or false)

### Variable & Const
  1. Variable:a place to save a value and it can be change
  2. const: same as Variable but the value it can't be changed

  ##### example:
      1. const BirthYear=1997 the year I was born it will be the same and never be changed
      2. var age= 25 my age will change each year

### String interpolation
  a way to have a string with variables without using "concatenation"

 ##### example:
      var user = "faisal";
      var age =25;
      print("Hello $user my Age is $age" ); // writing a string containg a values

### Operators
  symbols used to do a specific job through the code

  ##### for example:
      1. plus sign (+) it can be used to add numbers (var x=5+5;) x value will be 10
      2. double equal (==) comparing two value if(5==5) which will be true

### Null Safety
  its a way to prevent error by not letting the variable have a null value

  ##### for example
      1. int x=9; here x cant be null, it can be only an int (whole number)
      2. int? y; here y can be a null value or an int
