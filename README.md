# Homework 3

Explain each subject below, and provide at least one example.

List item

**- Main and Print**

- main: The most important function, with it we can print and implement scripts.

EX:

    void main()
    {

    }

- Print: Method known in all programing languages, used to display
  different type of output to the end user screen.

EX:

    void main() {

    print('hello world');

    }

**_-Syntax_**

- Syntax: A set of pre-defined rules and concepts in the programming language, which helps in creating different scripts in one program.

EX:

    void main() {

        int A = 4;

        int B = 5;

        print( A + B );
        }

**-Data Types**

- Data type: Predefined attributes in the programming language through
  which the type of values ​​and their space in memory can be
  determined, and we can impose these attributes on the program and the
  end user.

EX:

Integer
String

**-Variable & Const**

- Const: The entered data cannot be modified by the program or the end
  user.

EX: `const PI = 3.14159;`

- Variable: Flexible data that can be modified at any time within the
  program.

EX: `var stocks = 4.3;`

**-String interpolation**

- String interpolation: reformat and insert a value into placeholders.

EX:

    int age = 25;

    print("my age is $age");

**-Operators**

- Operators: set of logics used to simulate different type of method.

EX: Arithmetic Operators(+,-,\*,/)

**-Null Safety**

- A way to protect the program if there is no value for a variable, or there may be no value.

EX: `int? aNullableInt = null;`
