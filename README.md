# Homework 3

Explain each subject below, and provide at least one example.

* Main and Print :
  
The main function is a function at which any code starts.
 An example of this is a code from Dart 
 
  void main() {
  runApp(
  )
   }

As for printing, it is a software command through which anything can be printed without any error,
 and we need this sometimes to print some variables, for example print("Hi")

* Syntax :

 It is a way to write sentences so that the computer understands them and has certain rules and the rules differ according to the programming language, for example,
Java has great sensitivity to characters and other languages such as,
(Basic and SQL) are not sensitive to the case of the character

* Data Types :

 No programming language can be free of data types. Data types may differ from one language to another,
 but data types exist in all programming languages and the usefulness of data types are values that the system deals with, saves, or enters by the user, and an example of this
integer : for integers
double: for decimal places
String: for alphabets and numbers
Boolean: Represents Boolean values such as (True or False) (1 and 0).

* Variable  & Const :
 
The variables can be changed by anyone at any time without the need for the programmer’s permission. The constants can only be changed with the permission of the programmer.
For example, a program can be developed to measure the age on the day of birth.The user’s age cannot change, but the user’s age changes every day

* String interpolation :
 
String interpolation is a method by which we insert a variable,
constant or expression into a string for example
void main() {
 String text = 'Educative';
 print('The word $text has ${text.length} letters'); 
}

* Operators :

Operators are codes written to perform arithmetic,
logical, and relational functions. It is used a lot for software development,
including:
Arithmetic Operators: [+, -, *, /, %, ++, - - ]
Relational Operators:[ ==, =! , <, >, =>, <=]
Logical Operators:[&&, || ,!]
 
* Null Safety :
prevents errors that result from some null variables.Sometimes the application does not understand null variables because the program expects us to enter a valuefor the variable and we basically want it to be null and this is a null safety feature
