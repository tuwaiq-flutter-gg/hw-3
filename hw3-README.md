# Homework 3


* Main and Print  
 Print: in many language commands (Print) who send text or any opject to screen for print it.
 Main: is the function that work as point to start any programming and type for main is int.
 
* Syntax
 It is a set of rules set by language designers in an orderly and homogeneous manner so that the programmer understands them and then turns into a machine language.
 
* Data Types 
 are the way a programmer tells how he intends to use data to deal with memory, All languages share the same essence, but the difference is only in terminology.
 
* Variable  & Const 
Constants can be defined that the fixed value does not change over time, such as the size of the table or the type of cloth. The constants are usually used in numbers and defined values.
Unlike constants, variables change over time, such as a person's weight and height. Also, variables are usually used for letters, symbols, and undefined values.

* String interpolation 
 is the process of replacing an element with another value and is often surrounded by elements like ($ or %) in most programming languages for example (Hello $frist-name) the goal is to replace the placeholder name with the real name.

* Operators 
 are symbols that usually represent an arithmetic procedure or operation. These symbols have been adapted from mathematics and logic and are capable of manipulating a specific value or parameter.

* Null Safety
 is there to prevent errors from accidental access to variables, for example if a method expects a true value but receives a null value then the program will not run
